Data Analysis Review - Due Week 2 Spring (Hard Deadline)

How the project will be done.

No structure, 5 page limit.
Not a coding exercise, but might need to write some code.

Need to talk about the tools needed to extract the information (Prospector).
(Maybe do a sample fit with SSDS)
Identify and describe python module do I need.
Identify and describe software do I need.
Install them.

Explain the process of the data anaylsis

How to use formula I need
How to create the plots I want to use.

A detailed to-do list of the pipeline the data goes through.

Here can add (then need to do more research) and kill ideas.

Demonstrate the real feasibility of the scientific goals

Reference papers that the describe the method. Use papers to suggest plots you want to have or create for your paper (and describe the steps).

A clear data analysis review will call for the creation of a clear to-do list for the project.


How to structure it:
Driven by the scientific goals: I want to answer these questions and this is what I need to do
OR
Shopping list method: to do this, I will do that
OR
Chronologically: Kick off with images, then step 1, then step 2.

After data analysis the proposal is next.
Proposal is a 4 page (hard limit).
The proposal establishes the real goals for your project. What is presented in the final paper will be compared to what is proposed.


Can reuse words, sentance and other stuff I've already used.
Self-plagerism is ok!
